\f0\fs24 \cf0 Extinction Beckons - Mike Nelson, Hayward Gallery London\
\
I worked with Mike and 3 others in the lead up to this ambitious exhibition bringing together many of the large scale installations from Mike\'92s career. In the 3 months leading up to the install we worked in an old Argos warehouse in Orpington, Kent using cobbled together documentation and photographs from the past 3 decades to reconstruct and modify the works for the galleries at the Hayward. We were joined by various gallery staff and an exhibition build team to complete the gallery install with a 1 month deadline. Beyond the impressive scale of the work, it\'92s the need for attention to Mike\'92s idiosyncratic approach to construction, detailing and hardware that prompts me to show this project.}
