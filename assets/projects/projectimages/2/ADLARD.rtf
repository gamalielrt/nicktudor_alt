\f0\fs24 \cf0 A suspended double wardrobe. Designed for a compact bedroom, I used a curve to soften the projection into the room. The Alpi Myrtle Burr veneer was reverse slip matched, creating a consistent, subtle and interesting texture across the piece. Bespoke knobs were turned in contrasting black walnut. Simple, economical shelves and and hanging rail occupy the interior, all constructed from sustainable poplar plywood. }
